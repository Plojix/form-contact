        Trump’s landslide Iowa win is a stunning show of strength after leaving

        Former President Donald Trump’s huge win in the Iowa caucuses on Monday
        enshrines one of the <b>most</b> astonishing comebacks in American
        political history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Losing one-term presidents almost never mount subsequent successful
        primary campaigns, much less pull off landslides that demonstrate utter
        dominance of their party. Trump transformed the GOP in his populist,
        nationalist, nihilistic image in 2016.<b>By claiming 50% of the vote</b>
        in the biggest win in caucus history, putting him on course to his third
        consecutive nomination, he showed that eight years after his outsider
        presidential victory, the current GOP is entirely his party.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The big night is going to be in November, when we take back our
        country,” Trump told his first proper victory party since he shocked the
        world by winning the 2016 election. His MAGA-hat wearing crowd greeted
        him with chants of “Trump, Trump, Trump” beneath two vast screens
        reading <i>“Trump wins Iowa!”</i>

      <h2>Spirit Airlines shares plunge after judge blocks JetBlue merger</h2>
      <h4 class="subtitlu">A Spirit Airlines plane takes off</h4>
      <img class="centerimg" src="imagini/spirit.jpg" width="700" />
      <p>
        <b>New York CNN</b> — Spirit Airlines shares tanked 53% on Tuesday after
        a federal judge in Boston ruled against JetBlue’s acquisition of the
        company.
      </p>

      <p>
        “In light of the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it
        is hereby ordered that the Defendant Airlines, their agents, servants,
        employees, and all persons acting in concert with either of them, are
        permanently enjoined from executing the proposed merger as agreed on
        July 28, 2022,” wrote Judge William Young on Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion purchase of discounter Spirit would have
        produced the country’s fifth-largest airline, a deal the carriers said
        would help them better grow and compete against larger rivals like Delta
        and United
